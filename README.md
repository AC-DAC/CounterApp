# CounterApp
 Working name

An idea to translate my 'pen and paper' approach to keeping count of my exercise regiment to a mobile application.

This is my first personal project after thinking about what I can make as a purpose to learn how to develop mobile apps from start to finish.

=== My Learning Journey ===

Initially jumped straight to developing using React Native, but realised I needed to take a BIG step back. I built an HTML version which I am more familiar with then produced a ReactJS version after getting stuck with React Native. Worked out my confusion between ReactJS and React Native, and understood that AI tools in IDEs still require some hand holding.

So far, the React Native version will be the 'concept' to producing a more full fledged app with a more planned UI/UX. The concept currently works as a WebApp, semi broken on iOS, and not tested on Android yet.

Overall, this journey has taught me that developing with software like Cursor / Trae, and React Native invaluable to get my ideas across quickly. 

Excited to continue with my learning. I'm still a noob, figuring things out as I go, and open to guidance and support to get better.
